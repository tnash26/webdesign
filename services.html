                        <h3>Web Site Design</h3>
                        <p>63% of consumers primarily use your company’s website to find and engage with you. As if that’s not enough, 48% of
                        people cited a website’s design as the number one factor in deciding the credibility of a business. What does your
                        website say about your business?
                        </p>
                        <p>Pricing: $50 USD - $150 USD</p>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Web Site Maintenance and SEO</h3>
                        <p>
                            Keeping a website well maintained and attractive is important to companies big and small in order to engage and retain
                            customers. It’s easy for businesses, especially startups, to cut corners and let a few tasks slide. Website maintenance
                            can easily become one of those things as it doesn’t always present immediate issues. However, just like your health can
                            fall apart if you go too long without a regular check up, so can the health of your website.
                            Regular monitoring of your website is a must for keeping your business running smoothly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            97% of online experiences begin with a search engine, but 41% of clicks go to the top three paid ads on the search
                            results page. Pay per click is a great way to drive more (qualified) visitors to your website and get more leads and
                            sales—FAST! The best part? There’s no waiting period.
                        </p>

                           your long-term authority and get more qualified website traffic, leads, and sales with search engine optimization (SEO).

                        <h3>Web Site Hosting</h3>
                        <p>Web (or Shared) Hosting is the most budget-friendly type of hosting. Since you're sharing resources — like neighbors in
                           an apartment building — you spend less but have fewer options and less control.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and Business Hosting dedicate specific portions of a web server’s capacity and processing
                            to each customer. Like a condo, your space (on the server) is yours.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dedicated Server Hosting — the mansion of hosting analogies — offers unlimited resources at a premium price. You can
                            choose between full root access or managed plans. It’s all up to you.
                        </p>
                        <p>Pricing: $5 - $15 USD per month</p>
